# angular_getPost_randomform
My First repository - A challenge by Ventursity
 

Hi DevTeam Ventursity

I like learning new things, 
beacause of this challenge i opened an account in github, created new repository.

The Challenge is not completely done, i will finish it, and mail you again.

 I succeeded getting the form elements from random-form URL link.
struggling in mapping or posting the submitted formData to random-form/submit link

The important tasks i handled during this challenge 
-  getting the form elements from random-form URL using $http service with GET method
-  handling the jsonData of random-form URL
-  appending the form elements in html page dynamically 
-  setting attributes like required , disabled based the jsonData for each form elements
-  setting and binding the ng-modal for each form elements
-  compiling the appended html using $compile service
-  handling autofill/autoselect data for each form elements
-  pushing all form element values to single formData jsonObject.



Thanks
